Project Description:

Smart Solutions for railways is designed to reduced the work load of the user and also the use of paper. Here in this project we have all the features shown below.

Features:
A Web page is designed for the public where they can book tickets by seeing the available seats.

After booking the train, the person will get a QR code which has to be shown to the Ticket Collector while boarding the train.

 The ticket collectors can scan the QR code to identify the personal details.

A GPS module is present in the train to track it. The live status of the journey is updated in the Web app continuously

All the booking details of the customers will be stored in the database with a unique ID and they can be retrieved back when the Ticket Collector scans the QR![picture 33](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113281596/202747835-90a1afe9-cbf9-44ac-9a0d-bdb14ac6dc5f.png)
